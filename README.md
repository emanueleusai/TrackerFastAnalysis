# Tracker fast analysis

Repository aiming at putting together a ntuplizer / analyzer for fast analysis of tracker data

Splitted in the following way:
- CalibTracker : central CMS tool used for the production of the ntuples from RECO files

Status:
- CalibTracker : running on data / MC, cosmics / collisions. Contains clusters, tracks, ...

More information:

Todo list:
- add muon information
- allow tuning of event content to control the size of the output files
- allow sampling of events from collisions to control the size of the output files

In parallel:
- adapt the geometry to allow running on CRack data

Quick setups:
- source setup.sh [on lxplus]
